    <H1>7 kyu Disemvowel Trolls</H1>
    <p>Trolls are attacking your comment section!

        A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
        
        Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.  
    </p>
        <p>For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".</p>
        
        Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
