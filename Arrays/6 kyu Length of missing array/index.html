    <h1>6 kyu Length of missing array</h1>
    <p>You get an array of arrays.    </p>
    <p>If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.</p>
    <p>But one array is missing!</p>
    <p>You have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.</p>
    <pre>Example:
        [[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] --> 3
    </pre>

    <p>If the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.</p>
    <p>When an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!</p>
    <p>There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays.</p>
    <p>Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)</p>
    <p>I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.</p>
