    <h1>6 kyu Let's Recycle!</h1>
    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>You will be given a list of objects. Each object has type, material, and possibly secondMaterial. The existing materials are: paper, glass, organic, and plastic.</p>
    <p>Your job is to sort these objects across the 4 recycling bins according to their material (and secondMaterial if it's present), by listing the type's of objects that should go into those bins.</p>
    <p>Notes</p>
    <ul>The bins should come in the same order as the materials listed above</ul>
    <ul>All bins should be listed in the output, even if some of them are empty</ul>
    <ul>If an object is made of two materials, its type should be listed in both of the respective bins</ul>
    <ul>The order of the type's in each bin should be the same as the order of their respective objects was in the input list</ul>
    <p>Example</p>
    <div class="code_block">
     <code>
        <pre>input = [</pre>
        <pre>{"type": "rotten apples", "material": "organic"},</pre>
        <pre>{"type": "out of date yogurt", "material": "organic", "secondMaterial": "plastic"},</pre>
        <pre>{"type": "wine bottle", "material": "glass", "secondMaterial": "paper"},</pre>
        <pre>{"type": "amazon box", "material": "paper"},</pre>
        <pre>{"type": "beer bottle", "material": "glass", "secondMaterial": "paper"}</pre>
        <pre>]</pre>
        <pre> </pre>
        <pre>output = [</pre>
        <pre>["wine bottle", "amazon box", "beer bottle"],</pre>
        <pre>["wine bottle", "beer bottle"],</pre>
        <pre>["rotten apples", "out of date yogurt"],</pre>
        <pre>["out of date yogurt"]</pre>
